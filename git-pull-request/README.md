## Install

1.	First clone this repository to a directory of your choice.

		$ git clone git://github.com/liferay/git-tools.git

2.	Then edit your bash profile and add the following line:

		alias gitpr="source YOUR_DIRECTORY/git-tools/git-pull-request/git-pull-request.sh"
	
3.	Go to <https://github.com/account/admin> to find your API token. Then edit
	your `.gitconfig` file and add the following:

		[github]
			user = your github username
			token = your github API token

4.	Change into a local git repository and try it out! To see a list of all open
	pull requests on your repository, run:

		gitpr
		
	To see a list of all possible commands, run:
	
		gitpr help

5. If you want to use the alias ability you need to configure your git repo with
 		
		git config github.users.filename PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE (local to the current repo)
		
		git config --global github.users.filename PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE (global for all the git repos)
	
	Run the command gitpr update-users. This command will populate the previous file
	with all the info of the users who has forked your upstream repository
